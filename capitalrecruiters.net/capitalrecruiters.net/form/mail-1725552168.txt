<br />
I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the PHP Developer position at Capital Recruiters, as advertised. With over 5 years of experience in PHP development, along with a solid understanding of database management and web technologies, I am eager to contribute to one of the most innovative banks globally.<br />
<br />
I developed and supported numerous Middleware and Back-end processes using PHP, ensuring efficient communication between systems. I have successfully refactored existing code for improved performance and have a strong foundation in SQL databases, particularly PostgreSQL. My ability to optimize queries and manage large data sets has been key to enhancing application efficiency.<br />
<br />
My technical skills extend beyond PHP, as I also possess foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have experience using version control systems like Git and am well-versed in containerization using Docker, which allows for streamlined development processes.<br />
<br />
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to the success of your team at Capital Recruiters.<br />
<br />
Warm regards,<br />
Raphael Ram.<br />

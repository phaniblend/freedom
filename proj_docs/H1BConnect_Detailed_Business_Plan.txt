Executive Summary
H1BConnect is a legal-tech platform and staffing entity revolutionizing the H-1B sponsorship process. The service enables skilled professionals already working with U.S. clients to transfer their H-1B to a new, transparent employer of record who provides full legal compliance without the traditional exploitative cuts. Our USP: "We pay for your H-1B legal and filing fees, and you just pay a one-time setup fee of $3,500 and $500/month for full payroll and compliance."

This model empowers H-1B workers to retain nearly all of their billable rate, drastically reducing dependency on traditional bodyshops and consulting firms.
